## Description

This is an HTML, CSS, javascript, JQuery(for all dynamic page activity) role playing "combat" style game using the theme of the 2020 Democratic Nomination.
campaign and 2020 general election as a bonus round.
The player chooses a candidate from eight choices and plays the whole game as that candidate.
One by one the player faces off against the other candidates and campaigns to victory or loss against the current opponent.
If all 7 opponents are defeated the player wins the nomination and advances to the bonus round of the 2020 general election
against the sitting president.
A "News Feed" message box provides information and instructions during game play.
The player uses a multi-purpose button to move thru the "combat" rounds and advance from game page to the next.
The player clicks on candidate images ("badges") to select their candidate and opponents.
A chance to play again is presented whenever the player has lost - either in the nomination round or bonus round.

## Help

player badges show current "Favorable" % - this is their "Health" points
player attack rating goes up with each attack
when choosing opponent know that low Heath character could have a slightly stronger attack rating
and high Health character could have slighly weaker attack rating - so there is some variablity.
Road to victory is generally to attack low Health opponents first.
But know when choosing your character that a low Health one could win the game (sometimes)
if played well and if chance falls right.  Likewise a high Health character doesn't
guarenteed you will make to the general election.
